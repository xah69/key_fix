# key_fix
key_fix is a tool designed to address unwanted keyboard behavior on a laptop's main keyboard. It resolves issues such as continuous key presses, random key presses, or any disruptions that may interfere with your workflow. The tool achieves this by disabling the main laptop keyboard while allowing the USB keyboard to function seamlessly.
